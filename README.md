# React Entities

React Entities is an ultra-lightweight library that provides the simplest global state management for React apps. It takes advantage of React Hooks.

If you are familiar with Redux, you can consider this alternative for the following reasons:
- No complex boilerplate code required
- No need for reducers and dispatch
- Uses plain functions to implement actions
- No need for middleware and other added complexities
- Does not use Context API; has a straightforward subscription technique
